        This method computes disparity in predicted prevalence rates between two groups.

        Parameters
        ----------
        groups : Array-like
            Group indicators. Must contain exactly two unique values.

        y_pred : Array-like
            Binary model predictions. Positive and negative predictions must be 1 and 0, respectively.

        y_true : Array-like, default=None
            Binary labels (ground truth values). This argument is only a placeholder for this class.

        ratio : bool, default=False
